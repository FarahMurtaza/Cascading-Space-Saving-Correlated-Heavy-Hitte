# CSSCHH - Correlated Space-Saving with Correlated Heavy Hitters

CSSCHH is an implementation of the Space-Saving algorithm extended to detect correlated heavy hitters in a data stream. This project is developed in C++ and aims to provide an efficient and scalable solution for identifying frequently occurring items and correlated pairs.

## Introduction

Space-Saving is a streaming algorithm designed for identifying frequent items in a data stream with limited memory. CSSCHH extends this concept to detect correlated heavy hitters, providing insights into relationships between items.

## Features

- Efficient Space-Saving algorithm implementation
- Detection of correlated heavy hitters in secondary data streams
- Configuration options for adjusting algorithm parameters
- User-friendly interface for easy integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C and C++ compiler with C++14 support
- xxhash library (install using package manager or brew)

### Installation and execuation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FarahMurtaza/Cascading-Space-Saving-Correlated-Heavy-Hitter
cd CSSCHH
make
./main
